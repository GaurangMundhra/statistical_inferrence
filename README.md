## About

Statistical inference includes hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, and modeling. This repository provides implementations, notes, and resources to help learners and practitioners understand and apply these methods.

## Features

- **Sample code for statistical inference techniques**
- **Examples and datasets for practice**
- **Jupyter notebooks and scripts**
- **Documentation and theoretical notes**
- **Extensible for your own experiments**

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and explore the available notebooks and scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GaurangMundhra/statistical_inferrence.git
cd statistical_inferrence
```

## Installation

Depending on the language (Python, R, etc.) used in subdirectories, install the required dependencies.  
For Python projects:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For R projects:

```R
# Example
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Check each subdirectory for specific instructions.

## Usage

Explore the notebooks and scripts to learn about various statistical inference concepts:

- Run Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- Execute scripts for batch analyses
- Modify code to experiment with your own data
